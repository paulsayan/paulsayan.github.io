Hi, I'm **Sayan**.

A curious geek who loves to explore new emerging technologies and find innovative solutions to various problems.

Currently I'm associated with **Embedded Systems and Robotics** Research Group of [TCS Research & Innovation](https://www.tcs.com/research-and-innovation){:target="_blank"} as a Developer where I'm working on Cognitive Robotics, Human-Robot Interaction and also on Optimization algorithms for Warehouse Robotics. 
Previously, I was a developer in an EIS-IoT unit project in TCS.

Prior to that, I led [Robonix NSEC](https://robonixnsec.github.io){:target="_blank"}, the official Robotics Club of our college where I coordinated various robotics events & activities and mentored other students in Autonomous Robotics by conducting forums & sessions.

My interests broadly lies in (but not limited to) the areas of Robotics, Computer Vision, Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Internet of Things, etc.
