Hi, I'm **Sayan**.

I'm a curious geek, out-of-the-box thinker and a quick learner by nature who loves to explore emerging technologies and find innovative solutions to various problems.

Currently I'm associated with Visual Computing & Embodied AI Research Lab (previously part of Robotics and Autonomous Systems Research Lab) of [TCS Research](https://www.tcs.com/what-we-do/research){:target="_blank"} as a Senior Research Engineer. My research interests lie at the intersection of robotics, computer vision and machine learning (DL, RL, etc). In recent years, I have worked on robot vision / perception, 3D vision, visual SLAM, scene understanding, robot navigation, planning, autonomous exploration, human-robot interaction, and telepresence robots. I have co-authored several peer-reviewed journal and conference [papers](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=-XgsQ64AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate){:target="_blank"}. I'm also the co-inventor of several granted and filed patents. 

Prior to that, I led [Robonix NSEC](https://robonixnsec.github.io){:target="_blank"}, the official Robotics Club of our college where I coordinated various robotics events & activities and mentored other students in Autonomous Robotics by conducting sessions, forums & bootcamps.

I love to connect with different people to know about their unique journeys towards their life goals. I believe in lifelong learning, sharing and collaborating. And I also like to mentor and guide people in topics of my expertise.

Apart from that, I'm also a DIY embedded electronics and IoT hobbyist and sometimes try to make a thing or two at home in a frugal way.
