Hi, I'm **Sayan**.

A curious geek who loves to explore emerging technologies, learn new stuff and find innovative solutions to various problems.

Currently I'm associated with [Embedded Systems and Robotics](https://www.tcs.com/building-next-generation-smart-machines){:target="_blank"} Research Group of [TCS Research & Innovation](https://www.tcs.com/research-and-innovation){:target="_blank"} as a Developer where I'm working on Cognitive Robotics, Human-Robot Interaction and also previously worked on optimization algorithms for Warehouse Robotics. 
Before joining Innovation Labs, I was a developer in an EIS-IoT domain project in [TCS.](https://www.tcs.com/){:target="_blank"}

Prior to that, I led [Robonix NSEC](https://robonixnsec.github.io){:target="_blank"}, the official Robotics Club of our college where I coordinated various robotics events & activities and mentored other students in Autonomous Robotics by conducting sessions, forums & bootcamps.

My interests broadly lies in (but not limited to) the areas of Robotics, Artificial Intelligence (DL, RL, etc), Computer Vision, Internet of Things, etc.

Apart from that, I'm also a DIY embedded electronics hobbyist and sometimes try to make a thing or two at home in a frugal way.
